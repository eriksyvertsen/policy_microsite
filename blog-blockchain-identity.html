      <p>
        The current U.S. identity verification system lags behind modern capabilities, creating friction in
        financial services and introducing security vulnerabilities. <strong>Blockchain-based identity
        passports</strong> offer a secure, decentralized solution, but minor regulatory updates are needed
        to fully realize this innovation. Here's how policymakers can unlock the potential of
        on-chain identity credentials while preserving robust compliance standards.
      </p>

      <h2>The Regulatory Gap</h2>
      <p>
        Under Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions must verify customer identities
        through a Customer Identification Program (CIP). Current rules:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Rely heavily on repeated, manual KYC checks across multiple institutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Store sensitive data in many separate databases, increasing security risks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drive up compliance costs and create onboarding friction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By recognizing decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials on a secure blockchain,
        institutions can share reliable KYC results—reducing redundancy and better protecting user data.
      </p>

      <h2>Proposed Regulatory Tweaks</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Amend CIP Rules:</strong> Explicitly permit DIDs/verifiable credentials as valid components
          of a financial institution's CIP program. This leverages blockchain's immutable nature to
          strengthen, not weaken, identity verification.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhance Reliance Provision:</strong> Expand the reliance framework to accept
          cryptographically verified on-chain "reliance letters." If a user's identity was already verified by
          one institution, others can securely confirm via blockchain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Create a Safe Harbor:</strong> Provide liability protections for institutions that adopt
          qualified blockchain-based identity solutions. As long as they follow set best practices and
          verify token issuer authenticity, they remain shielded from undue enforcement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clarify Data Privacy &amp; Security:</strong> Permit zero-knowledge proof–based identity tokens
          on blockchains in line with Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) standards. Regulators can
          integrate blockchain-specific cybersecurity guidance into FFIEC handbooks.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Technical Model: DIDs &amp; Verifiable Credentials</h2>
      <p>
        The system relies on three pillars:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):</strong> Unique user-controlled IDs, not tied to any single
          centralized database.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verifiable Credentials:</strong> Digital claims (e.g. "Identity Verified") issued by regulated
          entities that can be cryptographically proven.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blockchain:</strong> An immutable ledger for storing reliance letters or credential proofs,
          ensuring shared verification without exposing raw personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits for All Stakeholders</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Consumers:</strong> Less friction in accessing financial services, fewer points of data breach,
        and more control over personal info.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Financial Institutions:</strong> Lower compliance costs, faster onboarding, and reduced fraud
        risk. Reliance on shared identity passports fosters easier collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Regulators:</strong> Enhanced oversight with robust audit trails. Blockchain's immutability
        ensures consistent application of verification standards while preserving a clear record for
        supervisory review.
      </p>

      <h2>Implementation Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Agency guidance—rather than lengthy legislation—could pave the way. <em>FinCEN</em> and the
        <em>federal banking regulators</em> can jointly issue interpretive letters or FAQs clarifying CIP
        acceptance of blockchain credentials. Industry groups (e.g., Chamber of Digital Commerce) can
        help draft best-practice frameworks. Meanwhile, pilot programs under regulatory sandboxes
        allow real-world testing before broad adoption.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        By recognizing blockchain-based identity solutions and updating CIP rules accordingly, regulators
        can foster a more secure, efficient, and inclusive financial system. This approach doesn't lower
        standards—it leverages modern technology to streamline compliance, reduce data vulnerabilities,
        and enhance oversight. Let's modernize our identity verification framework and usher in the next
        era of secure digital finance.
