        As seed investments balloon and more founders emerge from every corner of
        the world, small venture capital (VC) funds have never been more vital in
        shaping the future of innovation. Yet many first-time or smaller-scale fund
        managers are finding it harder to operate under the current limits of
        Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act. That's where the new
        legislative proposal, the <strong>Improving Capital Allocation for
        Newcomers (ICAN) Act</strong>, comes in. Below, we break down what's
        changing, why it's crucial for early-stage capital, and how it could
        energize our entire startup ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h2>The Current Hurdles for Small VC Funds</h2>
      <p>
        Under Section 3(c)(1), privately offered funds can skip registering as
        "investment companies"—a regulatory relief that helps smaller players get
        off the ground. But even after the SEC's 2023 adjustment (raising the
        exemption threshold from $10 million to $12 million), small funds still face
        two big constraints:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Investor Count Cap</strong> – Funds can have fewer than 250
          accredited investors, limiting the ability to pool many smaller checks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Capital Limit</strong> – The $12 million threshold hasn't kept pace
          with bigger seed rounds and rising valuations, leaving smaller funds short
          on diversification.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For new and diverse fund managers, this is especially tough. They often raise
        from a broader base of smaller investors—yet the 250-person limit and modest
        capital cap can stall momentum before they really begin.
      </p>

      <h2>The Proposed Fix: ICAN Act</h2>
      <p>
        To address these barriers, policymakers have introduced the
        <strong>ICAN Act</strong>—a legislative update to Section 3(c)(1)
        specifically for small venture capital funds. Its two major moves:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Boost the beneficial-owner limit</strong> from 250 to
          <strong>2,000</strong> for qualified small VC funds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Raise the fund size cap</strong> from $12 million to
          <strong>$150 million</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Crucially, the Act keeps accredited-investor requirements and other investor
        safeguards intact—modernizing, not removing, core protections.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Matters: More Capital, More Opportunity</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Broader Access</strong> – Up to 2,000 accredited investors means a
          bigger pool of supporters, especially those writing smaller checks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Greater Inclusion</strong> – First-time and underrepresented fund
          managers often rely on large networks of smaller backers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fuel for Underserved Geographies</strong> – Startups outside major
          tech hubs can benefit from local or regional funds that have more room
          to grow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stronger Startup Formation</strong> – More capital fosters
          competition, creativity, and job creation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Maintaining Investor Protections</h2>
      <p>
        The ICAN Act still requires accredited investor status and upholds anti-fraud
        provisions and fiduciary duties. In other words, it's about updating the rules
        to match the realities of 2025, not discarding them.
      </p>

      <h2>Call to Action</h2>
      <p>
        We believe the <strong>ICAN Act</strong> represents a forward-thinking step to
        empower small venture funds—and, by extension, the founders they back. If you
        agree, now's the time to reach out to your representatives. Let's keep America
        at the forefront of innovation, one seed check at a time.
