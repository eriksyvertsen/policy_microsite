          As private companies stay private longer, early-stage investors face increasingly
          lengthy timelines before any liquidity event. In a 2019 policy letter
          (<em>AngelList 2019 Harmonization Comment Letter</em>), we highlighted how
          regulatory complexities and illiquid private secondary markets can hamper
          reinvestment, discourage new participants, and restrict capital flows to
          innovative startups.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The crux: <strong>Stage-appropriate liquidity</strong> allows accredited investors
        to access secondary sales—without imposing public-company-level obligations on
        early-stage ventures not yet ready for an IPO. By clarifying safe-harbor
        exemptions for limited resales and streamlining certain 1933 Act and 1934 Act
        provisions, the Commission could reduce transaction costs and enable more
        transparent private secondary transactions.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Stage-Appropriate Liquidity Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In the letter, AngelList emphasized that smaller investors who specialize in
        seed and pre-seed rounds often lock up capital for years. With more flexible
        secondary exit options:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          They can recycle capital into new startups, fueling additional innovation and
          job creation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seed investors remain incentivized to participate, rather than forced to wait
          a decade or more for a possible IPO or acquisition.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Recommendations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Simple Safe Harbor for Limited Private Resales:</strong> Provide
          accredited-only channels for partial liquidity events that do not trigger
          full public disclosure or Exchange Act registration. This fosters an orderly
          marketplace without imposing undue overhead on early-stage issuers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Integration of Secondary Transactions:</strong> Clarify that
          small, stage-appropriate secondaries won't be integrated with the issuer's
          primary offerings—removing a major barrier to startups blessing these
          liquidity windows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimize Redundant Disclosure:</strong> A more tailored approach to
          resale disclosure—especially for small-lot accredited transactions—helps
          sellers find buyers without an unwieldy compliance burden.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Ensuring Investor Protection</h2>
      <p>
        While advocating for these streamlined liquidity pathways, the letter also
        stressed that any adjustments should:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Remain limited to <strong>accredited investors</strong>, who have sufficient
          resources or sophistication to evaluate the risks of illiquid venture
          investments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Require that any general solicitation for these secondaries includes
          "reasonable steps to verify" accredited status (akin to Rule 506(c)).
        </li>
        <li>
          Preserve anti-fraud provisions and disclaimers about the uncertain time to
          exit, ensuring transparency around risk.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        By refining these exemptions, the SEC can support a healthier venture ecosystem:
        early investors gain partial liquidity, while capital can be recycled back into
        emerging startups. Meanwhile, founders retain control and avoid the complexity
        of early forced IPOs or heavier compliance. In short, <strong>stage-appropriate
        liquidity</strong> stands to benefit all stakeholders in the private markets.

        safe-harbor provisions to accredited-only secondary markets, reduce friction,
        and uphold investor protections.
