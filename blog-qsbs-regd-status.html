        <p>
          <strong>Issue:</strong> Any rollback of QSBS benefits or tightening of Reg. D
          accreditation standards would shrink the startup and accredited investor
          ecosystems—decreasing fund formation and overall investment flows.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Context:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <li>
            <strong>QSBS</strong>: Encourages early-stage, high-risk investments by
            offering capital gains tax relief.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reg. D</strong>: Key exemption fueling over $3 trillion in annual
            private offerings (SEC data), forming the bedrock of AngelList's accredited
            investor base.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Strategic Pillar:</strong> <em>Intelligence — KLO</em>; maintaining
        stable market structures is vital to data-driven insights and the platform's
        knowledge engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> By preserving both QSBS tax incentives and the
        well-established Reg. D accreditation standards, the industry retains the
        current level of capital deployment. This means more startups funded and
        investor capital recycled back into the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Opportunity Size:</strong> Combining direct (admin fee) and indirect
        (banking) exposure, the overall effect on AngelList's business remains
        favorable—<strong>no</strong> major contraction. If QSBS or Reg. D were disrupted, we'd
        expect a 10–15% reduction in platform activity and revenue. By <em>maintaining
        the status quo</em>, AngelList avoids that dip.
      </p>

      <h2>Why QSBS &amp; Reg. D Matter</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>QSBS</strong> (Qualified Small Business Stock) offers capital gains tax
        relief to early-stage investors, incentivizing them to invest in riskier
        startups. Meanwhile, <strong>Reg. D</strong> is the key SEC exemption that
        allows accredited investors to fund private companies without the burden of
        full registration. Together, they underpin much of the modern venture
        ecosystem—especially AngelList's syndicates and rolling funds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without QSBS, many angels might scale back their startup allocations. Without
        Reg. D, the pool of accredited investors would shrink drastically. Both changes
        would hamper fund formation, slow capital flow to startups, and ultimately
        reduce innovation.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact on AngelList's Business</h2>
      <p>
        AngelList's revenue relies on fund administration fees, SPV formation, and
        integrated banking solutions—activities fueled by a broad base of accredited
        investors seeking tax-advantaged deals. If QSBS and Reg. D remain untouched:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Steady or Rising AUM</strong> – As more capital flows into private
          markets (with no additional restrictions), AngelList's platform grows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Robust Deal Flow</strong> – A large pool of accredited investors
          plus QSBS benefits means more SPVs, funds, and syndicated deals form each
          year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stable Fees &amp; Revenue</strong> – AngelList avoids a 10–15% drop
          that could occur if the investor base shrinks or if angels invest less due
          to lost tax benefits.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In short, preserving these frameworks supports healthy volumes of new funds,
        fosters more startup formation, and aligns with AngelList's "Intelligence"
        pillar by ensuring a large, data-rich ecosystem to power insights and
        innovation.
      </p>

      <h2>Call to Action</h2>
      <p>
        Keeping QSBS and Reg. D intact is more than just business as usual—it's a
        strategic imperative for sustaining America's entrepreneurial ecosystem. We
        encourage policymakers to maintain these bedrock incentives and accreditation
        standards. By doing so, we preserve a thriving, data-rich venture ecosystem
        that fuels innovation, job creation, and opportunity for all.
