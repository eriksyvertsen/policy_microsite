          <strong>Issue:</strong> Despite recent reforms, retail investors remain largely excluded from private
          markets. Currently, an informal SEC position—rather than a formal rule—restricts
          registered closed-end funds investing more than 15% in private funds to
          accredited investors only. This effectively blocks most Americans from gaining
          exposure to high-growth private companies through regulated investment
          vehicles.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why This Gap Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Over the last decade, private companies have been staying private far longer,
        with the average IPO timeline extending from roughly four to eleven-plus years.
        Much of the wealth creation in technology now happens pre-IPO. Unfortunately,
        retail investors are missing out on these growth opportunities—unless they meet
        accredited thresholds or find roundabout ways to invest.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Longer Private Phases</strong> – Startups can mature significantly
          before going public, locking out everyday investors from those gains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Power-Law Returns</strong> – A small number of breakout successes
          drive outsized returns; limited access can mean missing that upside.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Diversification</strong> – Individuals can't easily access
          regulated, diversified funds that invest in private deals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Proposed Solution: IIOA</h2>
      <p>
        Enter the <strong>Increasing Investor Opportunities Act (IIOA)</strong>. This
        legislation aims to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prohibit</strong> the SEC from limiting registered funds' ability to invest in
          private funds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enable BDCs (Business Development Companies) and interval funds to exceed
          15% private fund exposure <strong>without</strong> restricting to accredited investors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create regulated pathways for retail participation, supported by
          <strong>disclosures</strong> and <strong>protections</strong> within the Investment Company Act.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By removing the 15% ceiling and the accredited-only rule, everyday investors
        could responsibly tap into diversified portfolios that include private tech
        companies—no more missing out on the lion's share of early-stage growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Why It Matters for Everyone</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Broadening Access</strong> – More Americans gain exposure to
          high-growth private companies through regulated vehicles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficient Capital Flow</strong> – Expanding the investor base can
          funnel more capital into innovative startups, fueling job creation and
          economic growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shared Wealth Creation</strong> – Rather than confining major returns
          to accredited investors, the public can share in the upside.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Maintaining Appropriate Safeguards</h2>
      <p>
        The IIOA doesn't compromise investor protections. Registered funds remain
        subject to the Investment Company Act's robust disclosure, governance, and
        reporting requirements. Professional management ensures diversified exposure,
        helping mitigate the inherent illiquidity and volatility of private market
        deals.
      </p>

      <h2>Call to Action</h2>
      <p>
        By passing the <strong>Increasing Investor Opportunities Act</strong>, Congress
        can open private markets to everyday Americans while preserving strong
        regulatory safeguards. It's time to modernize the rules so we can all
        participate in the growth of tomorrow's most transformative companies.
